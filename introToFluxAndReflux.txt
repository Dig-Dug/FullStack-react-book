before all state was flowing downward to children.

Flux is a design pattern----------------------------
View: dispatch actions to describe actions.
Store: receives actions, and determines state changes. After
is pushed back to View.

Flux:  breaks up state management logic.
       React Components are simpler.
       Mis-match between state tree and DOM tree.

REDUX---------------------------------------------
  .data = state <- storable.
  .app reads state from Store.
  .views emit actions.
  .reducer= new state comming from old state and actions taken.


Building a counter---------------------------------
