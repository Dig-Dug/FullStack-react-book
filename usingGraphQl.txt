GraphQl-- 
good for cross-platform applications and large teams.
Benefits 
--declaring exact data from server(less unnecessary data trafic, more speed)
--better for unit and integration testing

GraphQl vs Rest...
 rest--many similar endpoints waste network resources:
        /user/:id/profile  or /user/:id/profile_short/
in GraphQl endpoint can paramters specify many things :P

GraphQl works indepent from which database system or programming language
 you use.
(sql, mongoDB etc)

connect GraphQl server to components in React:
    Relay https://relay.dev/

2 ways of using GraphQl:
    1. Author of client web app
    2. Author of GraphQl server

Consuming GraphQl------------------------------------------
  clients retrieving data from GraphQl servers.

https://github.com/graphql/graphiql

https://lucasconstantino.github.io/graphiql-online/ <- online editor
https://github.com/graphql/graphiql <- play with queries.

entire string is called "document"
operations: query or mutation-  check jpegs graphQL.
selections: are fields
scalar types: int, string, float, boolean, id, enum, list, object
schema: collection of fields

Exploring GraphQl---graphs(nodes and edges)
interfaces: pg 606-

graphNodes------------------------------------
 define simple Node interface:

 interface Node {
    id: ID  <- should be unique
 }

 Viewer pattern(design)---------------------
 Graph Connections and Edges-----------------------
