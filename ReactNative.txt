React native-----------------------
https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started
Init;.............:
bootstrap app: 
    1. npm i -g react-native-cli02.0.1
    2. react-native init Playground

Routing..------------------------------
mapping url to a particular UI
routing in native is more like layers(array stack[push,pop]) instead of url mappings
route stack check: routeStack.png
in iOS:
    right to left(pop), left to right(push), bottom to top


<Navigator /> <-component, 2 props( //called everytime a route changes
    configureScene("which UI to render?") &
    renderScene("which transtion type?")
)

check: routeStack.png pictures

to know on which platform is the app running:
import { Platform } from 'react-native';
Platform: has OS prop which shows the platform on which the app is running.
'ios' or 'android'
